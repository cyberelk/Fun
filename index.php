//TEST

//
// Dear maintainer:
//
// Once you are done trying to 'optimize' this routine,
// and have realized what a terrible mistake that was,
// please increment the following counter as a warning
// to the next guy:
//
// total_hours_wasted_here = 25
//

//When I wrote this, only God and I understood what I was doing
//Now, God only knows

// drunk, fix later

// Magic. Do not touch.

// I'm sorry.

/*
 * You may think you know what the following code does.
 * But you dont. Trust me.
 * Fiddle with it, and youll spend many a sleepless
 * night cursing the moment you thought youd be clever
 * enough to "optimize" the code below.
 * Now close this file and go play with something else.

//I am not sure why this works but it fixes the problem.

/* Please work */

// I am not sure if we need this, but too scared to delete.

//Dear future me. Please forgive me.
//I can't even begin to express how sorry I am.

// I am not responsible of this code.
// They made me write it, against my will.

// I have to find a better job

// hack for ie browser (assuming that ie is a browser)

// TODO: Fix this.  Fix what?

// Any maintenance developer who can't quote entire Monty Python
// movies from memory has no business being a developer.

// Catching exceptions is for communists

// and there is where the dragon lives

// TODO make this work

# <magic type="voodoo">

# This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
